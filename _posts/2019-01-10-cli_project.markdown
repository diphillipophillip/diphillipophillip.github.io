This post is about my CossfitGem CLI project. Although this command line app is probably useless to most people, as the data probably only pertains to people that are intereted in Crossfit, it was still fun to make, and a little frustrating as well. I think a lot of people do projects either based on things they are interested in, or areas they are hoping to project their careers into. I chose to do this project on something I am interested in. 

My CLI project was hard to structure at first, I think writing down and mapping it out is an essential aspect to completing the project, which is something I did do at the start, but probably should have been more detailed. I got frustrated, as I didn't know the direction of where I was headed with my project. I decided to go back to the CLI music library project for reference which helped a lot. I tried to re-map what I had already done, and my new plan made more sense and provided some direction, which made it more fun than frustrating. 

Initially setting up the project was a little difficult. Luckily, Dakota provided me with a great video that showed setting up the bin files and using bundler. I also recieved some help from my roommate.

After everything was set up, it was just making sure I was pulling the correct data, and using it efficiently. I don't think my code was written as well as it could have been, as it was a little intimidating making my first project. But, after all it was the first thing we have created, so I can't be to upset about it. 

Overall, it was deffinitley a learning experience. I learned more about writing efficient code, setting up my code in a local enviornment, and to just be patient. I think the next project we have, whatever it is, I will do better than I think I did on this one.
