Hello!

This blog is to explain my Sinatra Project a little bit, and talk about my experience while making it. 


I didn't really know what I wanted my Sinatra Project would be. It was coming down to the wire, until my instructor suggested I do a fitness tracking app. I didn't really want to do anything fitness related, mainly because my CLI project was fitness based. But, I am happy I did it and happy with the outcome. 

My project was simple, but was fun to make. Basically, you can create a log and save it on the day you created it. You can create the log with certain attributes pertaining to whatever workout you did that day. For example, reps, sets, distance.. 
After you save it, you can view that log indiviually, or look at a list of all the logs you've created by date. Once you get to the point that you are viewing an indiviaual log, you can edit that log if you made a mistake. 

So, like I said, very simple. But it was a great learning experience.

Surprisingly, I didn't have any trouble making the app, which was much different from my CLI project. I think being confident, and having resiliance was the key to my success with this project. Not only that, having the browser to work with made a huge different as I was really able to see what my project was outputting.

So, in a nutshell, that was my Sinatra Project.

Hoping my Rails Projects goes just as smooth!
