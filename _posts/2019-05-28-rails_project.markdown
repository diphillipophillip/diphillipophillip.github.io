I have to admit, starting my Rails Project was a little scary, and I got stuck for a little while before I started making real progress. The issue was, I tried using a gem called Simple Calendar. And while I ended up getting what I needed out of the Gem, it created a lot of scaffolded code. So, I got extremely over whelmed. I didn't know what most of the code was doing because I didn't write it, and it was pretty frustrating. Once I realized I can't use a scaffolder for my project anyway, I decided I should just restart the entire thing. So, Once I did that, I knew exactly what I needed from the Gem so there wasn't a mess of extra code. The project began to come together and I ended up getting through everything relatively easy. I did have a little trouble with nested routes. Unfortunately I didn't do my routing from the inside out (I think that is the right way to reference nested routing), so it was kind a pain to go back in and put that stuff in. But, eventually I figured that out as well! Lastly, styling began to be a pain. I don't know how to use bootstrap. I learned slightly while doing my Sinatra App, but completely forgot by the time I got to Rails. Luckily, I remembered how to do Raw CSS. So I styled it using that, but I think it would have taken much less time had  I known bootstrap. 


All in all, my rails project was a great experience.  I learned a lot, and validated a lesson that I recieved from my Sinatra App. This is something you will learn once you do it. It's okay to be nervous before making the App, I'm sure everyone is. It's a lot to do, and a lot to deal with. But, the real learning comes from doing it. You're going to mess up, and make mistakes, but thats a part of the process. Once I graduate I plan to make an entirley new App, hopefully a little more complicated so that I can really solitify my knowledge!
