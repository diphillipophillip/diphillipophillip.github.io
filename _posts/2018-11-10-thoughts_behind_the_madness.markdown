Coding is the something that I have always been looking for. Something to get better at, something to look forward to, and even something to frustrate me. I have always been someone that likes to improve. Coding allows me to improve daily, in so many different ways. It improves my problem solving skills, my communication skills (when I need to talk a problem out loud with someone), and my patience. I believe everyone needs something like coding. Something that takes away the stress of the world, but in a productive way. I love that coding frustrates me, because that shows me that it is not easy, and I believe that anything worth having, doesn't come easy. So, to sum it up, I chose software develop because it challeneges me. Also, the thought of being able to actually create things reeled me in as well.
